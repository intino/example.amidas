# Amidas example
Amidas is a comprehensive tool designed to implement the concept of federation within an organization. Federation, in this context, refers to the collaborative framework through which disparate systems, services, and identities can seamlessly interact and collaborate while maintaining their autonomy and security boundaries. With advanced identification and authentication capabilities, as well as the ability to integrate various third-party services, the platform offers a complete solution for managing security and communication in the organizational environment.

## Starter code
The main code (Main) of DataHub is responsible for initializing and configuring the platform. Here is the code:

This code performs the following actions:
- Initial Configuration: An instance of AmidasBox is created using the arguments provided to the program in the format "name"="value". The arguments are described on https://intino.systems/wiki/index.php?title=Amidas
- Logging Level Configuration: The logging level is set to ERROR.
- Setup connector: Connectors are configured using additional parameters of the application. In this case a properties file where the parameters of connectors are described.
- Box Start: The box is started.
- Shutdown Management: A shutdown hook is added to stop the box properly when the program finishes.

## Features
The platform includes a set of features that make it useful for various applications:
